3 Trends in data

1) In the Latitue vs Max Temp scatter plot there's a consistent curve that stays within a 50 degree window. 
2) It's interesting how there are consistent spikes in the left, middle, and right sides of data in the Latitude vs Wind Speed scatter plot.
3) I also think its very cool/interesting that in the Latitude vs Humidity scatter plot you can kind of make out a world map!
